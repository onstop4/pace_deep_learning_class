For my midterm project, I created a PyTorch model to see if I could predict the ridership numbers for the NYC subway based on weather conditions. This was so that I also provided reasons why my model was only partially successful at finding a correlation. The hypothetical scenario behind this project was that the model could be used by the MTA to predict when the subway ridership is likely to be higher.

For my final project, I created a PyTorch model that could detect the digits used in house/building numbers. I then used this model to attempt to read all the digits detected in a single photo (excluding those with a low confidence score) and then sorted the digits to form the full number. The hypothetical scenario behind this project was that the model could be used to detect building numbers for Google Street View.
